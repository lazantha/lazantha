ðŸ˜„ When you use pip freeze > requirements.txt, it captures all installed packages and their versions, regardless of whether they are directly relevant to your project or not. This approach can indeed lead to unnecessary dependencies being included in your requirements.txt file.

To capture only the relevant packages for your project, you can use pipreqs, a Python package that scans your project directory for imports and generates a requirements.txt file based on those imports.
Here's how you can use pipreqs:
        ðŸ˜„ pip install pipreqs
        ðŸ˜„ pipreqs .
